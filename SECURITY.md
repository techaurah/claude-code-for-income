# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security problem in this repository, for example a lesson that teaches an unsafe pattern, example code that leaks credentials, or a config file containing a real secret, please do not open a public issue with the details.

Report it privately through the contact form at [techaurah.com](https://techaurah.com), with "Claude Code for Income course security" in the message. We aim to acknowledge reports within three working days and to fix or annotate confirmed problems in the affected lesson.

## Scope notes

- This is a teaching repository. Example servers favour clarity, and lessons say explicitly where production hardening differs from the teaching version (Lesson 05 (hooks as guardrails) and Lesson 28 (failure modes and ethics) cover the safety material in depth).
- Never commit real API keys, tokens, or personal data to your fork. If you accidentally commit a secret, rotate it immediately; deleting the commit is not enough.
- The checkers in this repo (tools/validate_course.py and the lesson audits) are tripwires for common shapes, not guarantees. If you find a shape they miss, that is a lesson improvement worth an issue, filed without the secret itself.
